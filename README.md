# ENG498FinalProject
Repository for my ENG 498 final project

Here is the link for the original data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

The above link is the full raw data, the file is too big to be uploaded to Github, so I only used the Team Attributes CSV file in my raw data. For future use, download the full data set.
