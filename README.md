# ENG498FinalProject
Repository for my ENG 498 final project

Here is the link for the original data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

The above link is the full raw data, the file is too big to be uploaded to Github, so I only used the Team Attributes CSV file in my raw data. For future use, download the full data set.

SQLite query used can be found in the finaldataanalysis.py file. This file can also be opened in Google Colab for better experience.

License will be in separate license.txt file

In order to contribute, please contact owner of the repository
